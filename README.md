# World_Weather_Analysis

##### Description

Jack loves the PlanMyTrip app. With new enhancement of that product, they’ve recommended a few changes to take the app to the next level. Specifically, they recommend adding the weather description to the weather data we’ve already retrieved in this module. Then, we'll have the customers use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. From the list of potential travel destinations, the customer will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, we are creating a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.
